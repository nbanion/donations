Predicting Donor Behavior
=========================

This project uses machine learning to predict donor behavior based on past
interactions. By using an approach like this one, nonprofits may be able to
improve their fundraising to advance their missions.

The data come from the `Data Science for Good: DonorsChoose.org`_ Kaggle
challenge. They include anonymized transactions from over 2 million donors.
